# AWS_Deepracer

I trained several models for aws deepracer, unfortunately I didn't have a ton of time but I'm hoping to experiment after the UVic hackathon. The more successful model I trained did well before losing that performance. As you can see in the reward graph, because I didn't reward completing the track or the number of steps taken to do so, the model began to drop drastically in performance. I wrote up another reward function that took advantage of the steps and reward parameters, unfortunately I don't have any model credits left so I was unable to train the model with the new reward function.

The race is on the 2018 re:invent track with the physical DeepRacer car, fastest lap of 3 tries is taken and fastest time wins.
